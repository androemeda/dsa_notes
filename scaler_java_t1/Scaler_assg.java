Input Format
First and only argument is the vector A



Output Format
Return one integer, the answer to the question



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [0, 1, 0, 2]
Input 2:

A = [1, 2]


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

1 unit is trapped on top of the 3rd element.
Explanation 2:

No water is trapped.

Problem Description
Given two integer arrays, A and B of size N and M, respectively. Your task is to find all the common elements in both the array.

NOTE:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it appears in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First argument is an integer array A of size N.

Second argument is an integer array B of size M.



Output Format
Return an integer array denoting the common elements.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
 B = [2, 3, 1, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 1, 4, 10]
 B = [3, 6, 2, 10, 10]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 2]
Output 2:

 [2, 10]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Elements (1, 2, 2) appears in both the array. Note 2 appears twice in both the array.
Explantion 2:

 Elements (2, 10) appears in both the array.

Problem Description
Given a string A consisting of lowercase characters.

Check if characters of the given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

Return 1 if it is possible to rearrange the characters of the string A such that it becomes a palindrome else return 0.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105

A consists only of lower-case characters.



Input Format
First argument is an string A.



Output Format
Return 1 if it is possible to rearrange the characters of the string A such that it becomes a palindrome else return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "abcde"
Input 2:

 A = "abbaee"


Example Output
Output 1:

 0
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 No possible rearrangement to make the string palindrome.
Explanation 2:

 Given string "abbaee" can be rearranged to "aebbea" to form a palindrome.

/**
 * Q5. K Occurrences

Using hints is now penalty free
Use Hint
Groot has N trees lined up in front of him where the height of the i'th tree is denoted by H[i].

He wants to select some trees to replace his broken branches.

But he wants uniformity in his selection of trees.

So he picks only those trees whose heights have frequency B.

He then sums up the heights that occur B times. (He adds the height only once to the sum and not B times).

But the sum he ended up getting was huge so he prints it modulo 10^9+7.

In case no such cluster exists, Groot becomes sad and prints -1.

Constraints:

1.   1<=N<=100000
2.   1<=B<=N
3.   0<=H[i]<=10^9
Input: Integers N and B and an array C of size N

Output: Sum of all numbers in the array that occur exactly B times.

Example:

Input:

N=5 ,B=2 ,C=[1 2 2 3 3]
Output:

5
Explanation:

There are 3 distinct numbers in the array which are 1,2,3.
Out of these, only 2 and 3 occur twice. Therefore the answer is sum of 2 and 3 which is 5.
